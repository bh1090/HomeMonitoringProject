# Home Monitoring Project
This repository contains code files for the Home Monitoring Project.

Multiple families around the world have experienced situation where they would like to keep an eye on 
their loved ones such as children or senior citizen, so I developed a system which monitors different 
parameters of the home such as sound, light, etc. and sends them to a online Internet of things service 
(IOT) which allows the user to view their home parameter from anywhere around the globe.

This project collects various data parameters like sound, light intensity, and camera pictures (through
computer webcam) using an Arduino grove board and sends them to thing speak IOT using REST API. The 
user can then view live data about their house from anywhere using a device and an internet connection 
to monitor their home.

I created this system as I have experienced situations in the past where I would have benefitted from a 
system which allows me to monitor and check up on my home and my loved ones. Creating this system is 
important as it allows us, the students to be exposed to various object-oriented programming concepts 
and allows us to gain experience developing projects and learn skills that can have real-world applications 
in a broad range of disciplines.
